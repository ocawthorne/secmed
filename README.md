# SecMed
<p>This project, built for Phase 3 of Flatiron School, aims to tackle one of the most time-consuming aspects of medicine, which is to ensure that a drug that a patient is taking does not interfere with another drug or an existing condition of a patient. There are two different types of account: a patient account and a doctor account, and the latter may create new appointments and enter drug prescriptions for the patient.</p>
<p>A patient can sign up using an email and password, or sign up using their Facebook credentials. A doctor's account is created outside of the application such that patient information is kept safe, although a doctor's account is used to create appointments and prescribe drugs while a patient's account is read-only, so a patient may only see their own medical records.</p>
<p>In addition to this functionality, a doctor may see the interactions and contra-indications for the drugs which a patient has been prescribed so that no conflicts of drugs occur (i.e. where two drugs do not act well together, usually by counteracting the other drug) and also that a drug prescribed does not exacerbate an existing medical condition.</p>

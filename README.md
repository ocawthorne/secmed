# SecMed
<br>
This project is a rebuild of the application I built for my Sinatra project, while completeting Flatiron's Online Software Enginnering Online Course. This application was rebuilt using the Ruby On Rails Framework. 
<br>
In this version of the application, a patient can sign up using an email and password, or sign up using their Facebook credentials. A doctor's account is created outside of the application such that patient information is kept safe, although a doctor's account is used to create appointments and prescribe drugs while a patient's account is read-only, so a patient may only see their own medical records.
<br>
In addition to this functionality, a doctor may see the interactions and contra-indications for the drugs which a patient has been prescribed so that no conflicts of drugs occur (i.e. where two drugs do not act well together, usually by counteracting the other drug) and also that a drug prescribed does not exacerbate an existing medical condition.


# Starting the Application

To view the application, fork and clone this repository
<br>
